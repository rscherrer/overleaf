# overleaf

Mock TeX project to show how Overleaf integrates with GitHub.

(Last presented to [TECE](https://github.com/tece-lab) lab on 15-02-2023.)

## What?

* What is **[GitHub](https://github.com)**? A platform that hosts your code (including manuscripts if you want)
* What is **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)**? An online TeX editor

## Why?

You may want to be able to switch between working on your manuscript with your collaborators or your supervisors online, making use of Overleaf's commenting tools, for example, while being able to work online on the same project and not be reliant on the Internet from time to time. You may also like Overleaf but still want your manuscript to live close to the rest of your project (e.g. code, data). If that is your case you may like thee GitHub integration tool offered by Overleaf. Here is a *very* short description of how it works (this repo was more designed to be used as an example during a live tutorial).

**Note:** Hosting your manuscript on GitHub does not mean it is public for everyone to see before publication! As for any repo, you can set the visibility to **Private** instead of **Public**.

## Prerequisites

* A GitHub account
* A **premium** (or **old** --- prior to v2) Overleaf account (you can get premium with your RUG account)
* A TeX compiler (for offline work, e.g. [TeXStudio](https://texstudio.org))

## Steps

1. Create a repo on GitHub
2. Set it up locally
3. Import it into Overleaf
4. Start working on it

OR

1. Create a new project on Overleaf
2. Export it to GitHub (Overleaf will ask you if you want the newly created repo to be Private or Public)
3. Clone it locally
4. Start working on it
