(Last presented to [TECE](https://github.com/tece-lab) lab on 15-02-2023.)

* What is GitHub? --> A platform that hosts your code (including manuscripts if you want)
* What is Overleaf? --> An online TeX editor

## Prerequisites

* A GitHub account
* A **premium** (or **old** --- prior to v2) [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) account (you can get premium with your RUG account)
* A TeX compiler (for offline work, e.g. [TeXStudio](https://texstudio.org))

## How to

1. Create a repo on GitHub
2. Set it up locally
3. Import it into Overleaf
4. Start working on it

OR

1. Create a new project on Overleaf
2. Export it to GitHub
3. Clone it locally
4. Start working on it
